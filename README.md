# Virtual-Herbal-Garden
The Virtual Herbal Garden is an interactive website designed to make learning about medicinal plants easy, engaging, and accessible for everyone. It lets users explore detailed information about various herbs, view 3D models, take guided virtual tours, and even bookmark plants for future reference.
Whether you're a student, researcher, or just someone curious about herbal remedies, this platform offers a rich, immersive experience that goes beyond static text and images.

Built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project brings together traditional herbal knowledge and modern web technology. Feel free to explore the code, try it out, and see how it all comes together!


Note: This repository contains only the essential code files for the Virtual Herbal Garden project, such as index.php, styles.css, script.js, plants.php, diseases.php, and the login page files. Other supporting files, such as the database connection scripts, media files (images, videos), and configuration files, are not included here for simplicity and due to size constraints. These files are required for full functionality and can be added as needed for project setup.
